# Progress

## 2026-06-29 — Staff attendance, payroll removal, admin custom orders

- Added staff attendance / «بصمة الموظفين» model and APIs: admin-controlled shift times, grace minutes, per-minute late deduction, network/location verification settings, staff check-in/check-out, attendance records, and override support.
- Added per-staff attendance overrides so each employee can have a custom arrival/departure time, grace window, and per-minute deduction while others keep the default schedule.
- Linked late attendance deductions to the existing payroll ledger with soft-delete/source tracking.
- Added admin removal for manual «حافز» and «خصم» transactions.
- Added admin custom order creation using the existing full-set order form/persistence, with optional wholesaler attachment.
- Added frontend pages/entry points for `/admin/attendance`, `/admin/custom-order`, and staff self-service attendance on `/staff/me`.

Verified:
- Applied migration `052_staff_attendance.sql` to the configured database.
- Applied migration `053_staff_attendance_user_settings.sql` to the configured database.
- Backend smoke script passed for attendance check-in, manual salary transaction removal, and admin custom order creation (temporary data cleaned up).
- Backend smoke script passed for per-staff attendance override: default 9:00, staff override 10:00, check-in record used 10:00.
- Backend syntax checks for touched controllers/routes.
- Frontend `npm run lint`.
- Frontend `npx tsc --noEmit`.

Open:
- Browser smoke test still needed for staff check-in/out, admin attendance settings, payroll transaction removal, and admin custom order creation.
